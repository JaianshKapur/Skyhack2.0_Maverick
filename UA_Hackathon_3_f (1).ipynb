How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York. Have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again! *call disconnects*\\n\\nAgent: *sigh of relief* Next! *keyboard typing, phone ringing in background* Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"primary_call_reason\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 54,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Baggage\",\n          \"Traveler Updates  \",\n          \"Products and Services  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 54514,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jennifer Cantu\",\n          \"Rachael Charles\",\n          \"Erika Gregory\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"elite_level_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.3222968825150845,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          2.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agent_id_y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 257532,\n        \"min\": 102574,\n        \"max\": 993862,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 383,\n        \"samples\": [\n          461615,\n          524342,\n          901733\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agent_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"calm\",\n          \"polite\",\n          \"frustrated\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"calm\",\n          \"polite\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"average_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14371548011149202,\n        \"min\": -1.38,\n        \"max\": 2.67,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.18,\n          -0.15,\n          -0.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"silence_percent_average\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.19203137555060695,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.98,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.68,\n          0.06,\n          0.98\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Handling_time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 774.301509250498,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 7140.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3180.0,\n          2940.0,\n          540.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speed_to_answer_time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 151.12977141285202,\n        \"min\": 180.0,\n        \"max\": 900.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          900.0,\n          360.0,\n          420.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WeekDay_datetime\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          3,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Hour_datetime\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          15,\n          23\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

How can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Jake, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling because I need to make a change to my upcoming flight. My name is Michael Smith.\\n\\nAgent: No problem Michael, let me pull up your reservation. Can I get your confirmation number or last name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: Sure, it's under Smith. The confirmation number is ABC-123546. The flight is from Chicago to Denver next Tuesday. \\n\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look here... *typing noises* Alright, I see your flight from Chicago to Denver on Tuesday. What change did you need to make?\\n\\nCustomer: Well, a work thing has come up and I need to fly out a day earlier now. Is there any way to change my flight to Monday instead of Tuesday?\\n\\nAgent: Let me check availability for Monday. *more typing* Hmm, it looks like that flight is pretty full on Monday. I'm showing a waitlist at the moment. Would you be open to an alternate airport like Milwaukee to get out a day earlier?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh, Milwaukee would be tough since I need to be in Denver. Any other options? This is a kind of last minute change.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with a last minute change. Let me see what other flights we have going through our hubs umm, maybe we can string something together. *searches for a few moments* Okay, it looks like we have space available on a flight routing through Washington D.C. that would get you into Denver about an hour later than the original flight. Would that work with your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm, an extra hour isn't ideal but if that's the best option then I'll take it. What would the cost be to change my flight? I'm guessing it won't be cheap.\\n\\nAgent: You're right, last minute changes usually come with a fee. Let me take a look at any potential rebooking fees for your tickets. *more typing* It looks like the fee to reissue those tickets would be $150 per person since this is within a week of travel. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: Oof, $150 is steep but I guess it's better than missing my meeting. Okay, go ahead and switch me over to that Monday flight through D.C. then. My credit card on file should be the same one.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I've got you switched over to that Monday flight now. The new confirmation number is XYZ-258963. Let me send you an email receipt as well. Thank you so much for being understanding about the last minute change fees. I hope the rest of your travel plans go smoothly! Don't hesitate to reach back out if you need anything else.\\n\\nCustomer: Thank you so much for your help Jake, I really appreciate you getting me on that earlier flight. You all have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could help. You have a good trip and take care!\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! *call disconnects*\\n\\nAgent: *sigh of relief that the call went smoothly* Next!\\n\\nHow was that? I tried to make the dialogue between the agent and customer sound natural by including pauses, filler words and looking things up as would happen in a real call. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand on anything.\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, my name is John how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi John, thanks for taking my call. I have a question about my upcoming flight to Denver next week. *background noise*\\n\\nAgent: No problem, what would you like to know about your flight?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I booked the flight about a month ago but I've been having some second thoughts. My meeting in Denver got rescheduled and now I'm not sure if I'll need to be there on the dates I have the ticket for. I was wondering what my options are for changing or canceling the flight.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, meeting schedules can change last minute. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look at your ticket. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like you booked a non-refundable economy fare so you wouldn't be able to get a full refund. However, we can change your flight dates without a fee. What were you looking to change your travel to?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's what I was afraid of. *sighs* The new dates for my meeting are two weeks later, so I'd need to fly out on the following Tuesday instead of the original Monday. Would I have to pay anything extra to switch to the later date? Money is a little tight right now. \\n\\nAgent: Let me run through the fare rules and price differences...*more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on that subsequent Tuesday flight. Good news is because it's within a week of the original travel dates, there wouldn't be any additional charge to move your departure to then. I'd be happy to switch your reservation over to the new dates.\\n\\nCustomer: Oh wow, that's great to hear then. Yeah, go ahead and change it to the following Tuesday please. I really appreciate you checking into that for me John.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help make the change without any fees. One moment while I process this for you...*typing noises* Okay, it's all set. You'll be flying out on Tuesday the 27th now instead of the original Monday. Thank you for being understanding about the non-refundable nature of the fare. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist with today!\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks so much John, I feel a lot better about the trip now. Sorry to bother you with changing things last minute. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out. Well I think that covers it for now. You have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: No bother at all, that's what we're here for. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to Denver! You have a great rest of your day as well. Thank you for calling United, goodbye.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Bye! *calldisconnect tone*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah um my name is Mark. I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to San Francisco next week.\\n\\nAgent: Okay Mark, what seems to be the issue with your flight? Let me pull up your reservation.\\n\\nCustomer: Well see the thing is, something came up and I need to change the dates of my trip. Is there any way I can reschedule my flight for a few days later? \\n\\nAgent: Let me take a look here...(typing noises)...okay I see your flight is booked for next Thursday leaving Chicago at 10am and arriving in San Francisco at 12:30pm. What were you looking to change the dates to?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm I was hoping to maybe push it back to the following Monday or Tuesday if possible. Something came up with work and I need to be there a little later than originally planned.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me check availability for those dates...(more typing)...unfortunately it looks like flights are pretty full for Monday and Tuesday. The best I can do is offer you a flight leaving Chicago on Sunday that would get you into San Francisco around 11am. Would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah Sunday might be pushing it too. Do you have anything available for Wednesday maybe? I'm just trying to buy myself a few extra days you know? This is kind of last minute. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, let me check Wednesday for you...(typing for a bit)...okay, it looks like we do have seats available leaving Chicago on Wednesday morning at 8am, arriving in San Francisco at 10:30am. Would that work with your schedule? I know it's not a perfect solution but it's the best I can do given the short notice.\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah Wednesday should work, I think I can make that happen. What would it cost me to change over to that flight?\\n\\nAgent: Alright great, I'm glad we could find an option that works. The good news is because this is considered a schedule change rather than a cancellation, there wouldn't be any additional fees to switch over to the Wednesday flight. I'll go ahead and process that change for you now. It may take a few minutes to update in the system. While that's processing, is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No that takes care of it, I really appreciate you being able to change that for me last minute. Thanks for your help!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could assist. Thank you for calling United Airlines and I hope you have a good rest of your day.
